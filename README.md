This is a Capstone Project Report for my Data Analytics course at [Datafied Academy](https://github.com/Datafyde) - Data Heroes Cohort. <br>
As a pivotal component of the course, this capstone project leverages data analytics techniques to explore factors influencing customer churn in the banking sector.

# Problem Statement 
The financial services industry's ecosystem is dynamic and multidimensional, characterized by a complex interplay of factors that influence consumer behaviors. In this complex environment, the ability to retain customers is more than a strategic advantage; it is a requirement for long-term growth and sustainability. The inherent challenges of customer attrition for financial institutions include substantial revenue loss and the erosion of brand loyalty. 
A bank is experiencing customer churn that is impacting overall customer satisfaction and revenue, as well as they lack insights into the factors influencing customer decisions to leave or stay with the bank. There is a need to identify and address factors contributing to customer churn proactively.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information on 10,000 bank customers over six months. Each entry contains essential information like CustomerID, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Tenure, Balance, and more.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
We also defined metrics and KPIs that will help answer the business questions. Examples include: <br>
